                                My professional background is a blend of two passions: <strong>construction</strong> and
                                <strong>technology</strong>.
                                With over a decade of experience in residential and commercial construction, I’ve
                                successfully led large-scale projects
                                from planning to completion, managing crews, budgets, safety, and client relationships.
                                I take pride in delivering
                                high-quality work with a strong emphasis on detail, safety, and efficiency.

                                Alongside construction, I have cultivated a deep technical skillset in <strong>game
                                    server development and management</strong>.
                                From building communities around online games to developing custom mods and scripts, my
                                approach mirrors the discipline
                                and problem-solving required in construction: designing a strong foundation, integrating
                                complex systems, and ensuring
                                the end result is both functional and engaging.
                                and creating custom content. Looking ahead, I am closely following developments for
                                GTA-VI and the next generation of roleplay servers.

                                Experienced in designing, hosting, and maintaining DayZ servers since 2022. I create and
                                integrate custom mods,
                                troubleshoot bugs, and keep servers optimized through regular updates and balancing.

                                Configured and optimized servers for The Isle, a challenging platform that requires
                                careful setup but provides an incredibly
                                rewarding experience when tuned properly.

                                <strong>Construction Parallel:</strong><br>
                                Just as in construction — where success depends on planning, resource management,
                                safety, and precision —
                                game server management requires a strong foundation, structured systems, and attention
                                to detail.
                                Whether leading a team on a construction site or configuring a virtual world, my goal is
                                to create
                                safe, efficient, and enjoyable environments.

                                <strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
                                Across all projects, both digital and physical, I emphasize reliability, performance,
                                and collaboration.
                                For servers, I utilize VPS hosting to ensure stability and scalability. For
                                construction, I prioritize
                                safety, efficiency, and quality craftsmanship. In every environment, my strength lies in
                                bridging
                                <em>hands-on practical experience</em> with <em>technical innovation</em>.
